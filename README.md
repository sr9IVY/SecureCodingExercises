#Repo Structure

- `python_fixes/secure_fixes.py`: Secure implementations for Python vulnerabilities
- `nodejs_fixes/secure_fixes.js`: Secure implementations for Node.js vulnerabilities
- `java_fixes/SecureFixes.java`: Secure implementations for Java vulnerabilities
- `vulnerabilities/*.md`: Detailed write-ups for each vulnerability and its fix

# How to Use

Open this repo in **GitHub Codespaces** for a secure cloud-based development environment. Each fix is modular and testable. You can run Python and Node.js examples directly in Codespaces, and Java examples using a configured dev container.
